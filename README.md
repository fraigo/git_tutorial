## GitHub Account
   
   
### Create a GitHub Account

Go to https://github.com/ and create an account. You need an **username** , an **email**, and a **password**  *(Use at least one letter [a-z], one numeral [0-9], and a minimum of seven characters for your password)*.

In the next step, you can choose a personal **free plan** for **unlimited public repositories**. If you plan to host **private projects**, you may choose a paid plan for US$7/month. Also, you can set up an **organization**, to manage multiple users and permissions. 

Finally, in the last step, you can answer some questions (optionally) to **tailor your experience** to optimize your account to your needs. At this point, your account was created successfully.

You will receive an **email of confirmation**. Go to the "**Verify Email Address**" link provided to confirm your account.

   
### Configuring your account

You can do some configurations before using your account. Go to the right-top menu with an icon, and select "**Settings**"

Some basic configurations you may want to change or update:

1. Your **profile image**, pressing the "**Upload new picture**" button.
2. **Additional info** from your profile (public email, biography, and others).
3. **SSH Keys** to access your repository from a Git Client.



## GIT client 

### Download a GIT client

After we get and confirm the GitHub account, we need to install a **Git Client** to access your code locally, in your computer. The Git client can be **downloaded** from https://git-scm.com/downloads (Git Downloads):

1. [Git for **Windows**](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. [Git for **Mac**](https://git-scm.com/download/max)
3. [Git for **Linux**](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

### Install your GIT client 

The *instalation* process of Git Client is simple. You may be prompted to choose a few options while installing the client.

Once the installation is completed. You can **test the `git` command** in a terminal/command window:

    git 

The result will appear with a text like this:

    git version 2.14.3 (Apple Git-98)
    
If it shows an error message like this, you need to check your instalation process:
    
    git: command not found
