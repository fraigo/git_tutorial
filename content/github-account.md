In the next step, you can choose a personal **free plan** for **unlimited public repositories**. If you plan to host **private projects**, you may choose a paid plan for US$7/month. Also, you can set up an **organization**, to manage multiple users and permissions. 

Finally, in the last step, you can answer some questions (optionally) to **tailor your experience** to optimize your account to your needs. At this point, your account was created successfully.
