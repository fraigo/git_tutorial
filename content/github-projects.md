### Create a GitHub project

First, [login into your account](github-account.md#login-into-your-account). If it's your **first time** creating a project, you receive a Welcome screen with buttons to **Read de guide**, and to **Start a new project**.

If you press **Start a project**, you will be redirected to the [**Project creation**](https://github.com/new) page (https://github.com/new) to create a new *repository*.

In this page you can input the project information and initial configuration:

1. **Name** of the repository : A unique name using letters, numbers and hypens (-). Any special character in the name will be converted to hypen (`cool&fresh` will be `cool-fresh`).

2. Optional **description** : A long text to explain the purpose of your project.

3. **Public or private**: By default, your project is **public**. If you need a private project you need to consider to **Upgrade your account** (paying $7/month for unlimited private projects)

4. Initialize with **README**: Your project will start with a file named `README.md`, containing content to display when someone open your project page (https://github.com/your-user/your-project). Then, you can modify this file to add some extra information.

5. Add **.gitignore** : This is a special file with **rules** about *which files will be ignored* in your project (temporary files, backups, logs, special folders) when you are trying to **add new files** to the project. It's not necessary for a simple project, but you can choose a predefined file for specific types of projects (Java, Node, Laravel, etc)  

6. Add a **License**: If you plan to share your project with the community, you need to specify a type of License. For example, you can choose a "**MIT**" license to be less restrictive. You can get more information about licenses in http://choosealicense.com/
