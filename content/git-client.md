## Git client 


### Download a Git client

After we get and confirm the GitHub account, we need to install a **Git Client** to access your code locally, in your computer. The Git client can be **downloaded** from https://Git-scm.com/downloads (Git Downloads):

1. [Git for **Windows**](https://Git-scm.com/download/win)
2. [Git for **Mac**](https://Git-scm.com/download/max)
3. [Git for **Linux**](https://Git-scm.com/download/linux)

### Install your Git client 

The *instalation* process of Git Client is simple. You may be prompted to choose a few options while installing the client.

Once the installation is completed. You can **test the `Git` command** in a terminal/command window:

    Git 

The result will appear with a text like this:

    Git version 2.14.3 (Apple Git-98)
    
If it shows an error message like this, you need to check your instalation process:
    
    Git: command not found
